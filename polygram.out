Shifts: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]

Number of groups: 12

Length of each group: 5



STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION - ENCRYPTION


1. First, group your characters by dividing the number of characters in your message by the number of given shifts.

2. Then, shift EACH CHARACTER (including spaces and special characters) by the shift that corresponds to that group
Each group has 5 characters, except for the last group
Here are the groups: [I was,  born,  on J, anuar, y 11t, h, 20, 04, s, o my , zodia, c sig, n is , a Capricorn]

Let's encrypt a few characters!

On the right are characters from your original message, and on the left are encrypted characters

Finally your encrypted characters are reversed
